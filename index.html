                    learning the new things.<br>
                    I originally belong to Jaipur, Rajasthan.
                    I did my schooling from GR Global Academy and it was here only that my interest started developing
                    towards Web Development. We were taught HTML from 8th standard onwards. I am fond of creating
                    webpages since then. I scored 8.8 CGPA in Secondary and 85.8% in Senior Secondary.
                    <br><br>
                    I have done graduation in Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science from Jaypee Institute of
                    Information Technology, Noida Uttar Pradesh. My CGPA is 6.3. I took my minor as Management
                    Fundamentals where I learnt about basics of subjects like Human Resource Management, Marketing
                    Fundamentals, Financial Management and Financial Accounting.<br>
                    <br>
                    In my spare time, I like playing mobile games and listening to music.
                    I am "always ready to travel" kind of person.
